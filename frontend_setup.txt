# Frontend Setup Instructions

To create a new Next.js app, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest lead-capture-frontend --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

When prompted:
- Choose "Yes" for App Router
- Choose "Yes" for customizing default import alias (@/*)

After installation:
1. Navigate to the project: `cd lead-capture-frontend`
2. Install additional dependencies for OpenAI integration:
```bash
npm install openai
```
3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

# Connecting to Backend
The frontend will connect to the FastAPI backend using fetch API.
We'll implement this after completing the backend.
